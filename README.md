# maxFounderDiversity

_work in progress_

Algorithm to choose which populations to sample broodstock from and in what proportions to 
maximize genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity) in the population of offspring given a set of 
populations that could be sampled from (with known allele frequencies at a common set of loci) 
and a restriction on the maximum number of populations to sample.

Developed with the application of creating base populations for aquaculture breeding programs in mind
